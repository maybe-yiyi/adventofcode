## About this
so this year I decided to be a masochist<br>
and i will be attempting advent of code using nasm<br>
not sure if im going to be making a global function library or just writing functions in each file<br>
i will try to write good assembly but so far im being very lazy about it

## good luck trying to compile this
`nasm -felf64 -gstabs <filename>.asm && ld -melf_x86_64 <filename>.o -o <filename>`
